I am perhaps unreasonably pleased with myself for now being in possession of [gregory.sale][link]

Several months ago I wondered if I could improve on the professionalism of my email. 15 years ago it wasn't quite instilled on me how important the selection of an email can become an online alias for life. While my current one isn't particularly embarrassing, the dream really is `firstname.lastname@gmail.com`, or perhaps `firstname@lastname.org`.

After a bit of exploration I discovered most of my top options were either A: not available or B: very expensive. However I am in the somewhat unusual position where my surname is a valid [Top Level Domain][link2]... so the internet really made me an offer I couldn't refuse! I've already learnt a lot about setting up your own domain and web hosting.

As for the email... I suspect people would be baffled by `email@gregory.sale`, and computer systems obviously don't care (even before all the issues custom domains have with getting marked for spam)! Therefore I need an excuse to keep the website - rather unimaginatively this might feature a little blog.  I'd better find something insightful to say!
