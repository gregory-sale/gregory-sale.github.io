Hi, I'm Greg - welcome to my website!

## Engineering

I am a mechanical and thermofluids engineer based in Cambridge, UK. After graduating from Jesus College, Cambridge in 2019 I have stuck around to develop new technologies for PA Consulting, primarily in the energy transition sector, but also for medical and consumer clients.

## Everything else

I am a keen sailor (although a little lapsed in the last year it feels like) and currently secretary for the [Oxford & Cambridge Sailing Society](https://ocss.org.uk). I love to travel, climb mountains, and dabble in some skiing down them (although not very well). Also generally thinking or actively cooking at any point in time.

I am also renovating my first house, and like most engineers probably back myself a little too hard on occasion. So expect some snippets to feature occasionally.
